makeke
=========

Makeke, the Hawaiian word for market, is a web application written using the [Play Framework](http://www.playframework.com/) that
allows groups of people (perhaps students inside of a university department) to buy and sell books directly to and from each other.

## Capabilities
Makeke allows students to make offers and requests for books. All students in the system are able to see all offers and all requests.

The offers and requests provide information about the book such as name, condition, ISBN, market price, and asking/offering price.

To see our software in action, you can watch this [screencast](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNqb4rntZYU).

Our data model is described below.
