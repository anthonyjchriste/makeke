{"name":"Makeke","tagline":"A new approach for exchanging text books within a small community.","body":"### Welcome to Makeke!\r\n\r\n#### What is Makeke?\r\nMakeke is the Hawaiian word for market. This web application hopes to create a market that allows members of within small communities to exchange books.\r\n\r\nMakeke was written using the [Play Framework](http://www.playframework.com/) and [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/).\r\n\r\n#### What features does Makeke support?\r\nFor a quick (~8 min) overview of the current features supported in Makeke, please watch my [webcast about Makeke](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNqb4rntZYU).\r\n<hr />\r\n##### Separate Accounts\r\nMakeke allows users to create their own separate account to store offers and requests.\r\n![Account Creation](https://raw.github.com/anthonyjchriste/makeke/master/images/CreateAccount.png)\r\n<hr />\r\n##### Update Account\r\nUsers can update their account information (change e-mails, passwords, etc).\r\n![Edit Account](https://raw.github.com/anthonyjchriste/makeke/master/images/EditAccount.png)\r\n<hr />\r\n##### Book Explorer\r\nUsers can view offers and requests from all other users in the system using the Book Explorer. The book explorer also allows partial filtering of results. Currently, only filtering of book titles is enabled, but I would like to get the rest of the fields integrated as well in the future.\r\n![Book Explorer](https://raw.github.com/anthonyjchriste/makeke/master/images/BookExplorer.png)\r\n<hr />\r\n##### Active Requests / Offers\r\nManagement of a user's offers and requests. Users can view their current active requests and offers, add new requests and offers, and manage existing requests and offers from this screen.\r\n![Requests and Offers](https://raw.github.com/anthonyjchriste/makeke/master/images/RequestsAndOffers.png)\r\n<hr />\r\n##### New Requests / Offers\r\nUsers can create new requests and offers. If a book is already in the system, a user can select that book and the title, edition, and isbn will be copied to the correct fields.\r\n![Create Request](https://raw.github.com/anthonyjchriste/makeke/master/images/CreateRequest.png)\r\n<hr />\r\n##### Editing Requests / Offers\r\nExisting requests and offers can be edited or deleted.\r\n![Edit Request](https://raw.github.com/anthonyjchriste/makeke/master/images/EditRequest.png)\r\n<hr />\r\n#### Please Note\r\nYou will need to create an account on Makeke before interacting with the system.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
